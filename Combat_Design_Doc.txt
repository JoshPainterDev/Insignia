Item:

Maintain stance unless otherwise instructed by an item 


Stance change:

- Offensive
- Defensive
- Balance


Offensive: 

switch into, opponent in balanced: using the difference in speed between you and you're opponent, randomly decide if you can land a swift strike.
 
Swift strike: this is essentially a free quick attack. Your opponent takes some damage if the roll goes in your favor
Enables offensive abilities for use next turn

Switch into opponent who is attacking: players make speed rolls. If both players succeed they both deal small damage, if both fail nothing happens. 
If one succeeds they land swift strike.


Defensive:

switch into when opponent attacks: perform a defensive roll against the attackers attack to determine a block or parry 

Blocks are the default case, where attacks deal no damage, and abilities are reduced in damage. 

Parry negates an attack and deals damage to the attacker


Balanced: 

switch into when opponent defends: guard break your opponent opening them up for a critical strike

Critical strike is based on lethality stat and causes bonus damage

Switching into an opponents defense allows you to feint your attack, breaking their guard. This is guaranteed when your opponent switches into or remains in defensive state.
