Combat system design:

Level System:
- Player Levels - 

Each time a player levels up, there stats are all increased by a set amount:
Knight: +2 ATK / +2 DEF / + 1 PRS / +1 SPD
Occultist: +2 ATK / +1 DEF / +1 PRS / +2 SPD
Cutthroat: +1 ATK / +1 DEF / +2 PRS / +2 SPD
Guardian: +1 ATK / +2 DEF / +2 PRS / +1 SPD

A player's max health is based on defense and level:
playerMaxHealth = (70 * playerLevel) + (9 * GameController.controller.playerDefense);
